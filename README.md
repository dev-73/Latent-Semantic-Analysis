# Latent-Semantic-Analysis
Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a technique in natural language processing, in  particular distributional semantics, of analyzing relationships between a set of  documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the  documents and terms. LSA assumes that words that are close in meaning will occur in  similar pieces of text (the distributional hypothesis).
